This is a final project for the WBD4300.1 - JavaScript Application.

It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Bootstrap was used as a gridsystem for responsive design.

Majority of JavaScript was done using jQuery, the Accordion Sliding images and the image gallery are third party jQuery plugins.

An API was created to suit the needs of the website. And the API varies depending on what is clicked. Only one API is present but there are present slots for API-s to be put so that the content can change.
